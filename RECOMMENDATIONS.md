# LoanBrick Technical Recommendations & Roadmap

This document outlines the architectural, security, and performance improvements recommended for the **LoanBrick** application to reach enterprise-grade production readiness.

---

## 🔐 1. Security & Data Protection

The current implementation uses "placeholder" security that must be hardened for a financial application.

### A. Harden Encryption at Rest
*   **Current State:** `EncryptionService.ts` uses a basic XOR algorithm with a hardcoded secret.
*   **Recommendation:** Switch to **AES-256-GCM** (Authenticated Encryption).
*   **Implementation:** Use a library like `CryptoJS` or `react-native-quick-crypto`.
*   **Key Management:** Move the `APP_SECRET` to `expo-secure-store`. **Never** hardcode encryption keys in the source code.

### B. Secure Session Storage
*   **Current State:** Supabase auth tokens are stored in `AsyncStorage` (unencrypted).
*   **Recommendation:** Configure the Supabase client to use a custom storage engine backed by `expo-secure-store`.

### C. Network Security
*   **Recommendation:** Implement **SSL Pinning** to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, ensuring the app only communicates with the legitimate Supabase backend.

## 🚀 2. Scalability & Performance

As the database grows (10k+ loans/payments), JavaScript-side processing will lag.

### A. Native Database Aggregations
*   **Current State:** `MfiKpiService` fetches large arrays of records and uses `.reduce()`/`.filter()` in JS.
*   **Recommendation:** Use **WatermelonDB Native Queries** and `observeCount()` for metrics. For complex financial sums (e.g., Outstanding Principal), use raw SQL via the SQLite adapter to perform calculations inside the database engine.

### B. Enable JSI (JavaScript Interface)
*   **Current State:** `jsi: false` in `database/index.ts`.
*   **Recommendation:** Enable `jsi: true` for Native platforms. This removes the "bridge" bottleneck between JS and the SQLite database, offering 2x-5x faster data access.

### C. Sync Groups & Pagination
*   **Recommendation:** Implement "Sync Groups". Critical tables (Payments, Remittances) should sync on every app resume, while reference data (Categories, Areas) can sync once per day.

---

## ✨ 3. Code Quality & Maintainability

### A. Strict Typing
*   **Issue:** Heavy use of `any` in service layers.
*   **Recommendation:** Enable `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` and define interfaces for all DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) coming from Supabase.

### B. Atomic Component Design
*   **Recommendation:** Refactor UI components into "Atoms" (Buttons, Inputs), "Molecules" (StatCards), and "Organisms" (LoanForms). Separate business logic into custom hooks (e.g., `useLoanSync`) instead of putting it inside screen components.

### C. Centralized Value Formatting
*   **Recommendation:** Create a `FormatService` that handles currency, percentages, and dates centrally. This ensures that `₱ 1,000.00` is formatted identically across the mobile app, web views, and PDF exports.

## 🌍 4. Production Best Practices

### A. Observability
*   **Recommendation:** Integrate **Sentry** for crash reporting and performance monitoring. This is vital for debugging "Sync Hanging" issues on remote collector devices.

### B. CI/CD Pipeline
*   **Current State:** Basic Playwright setup.
*   **Recommendation:** Add GitHub Actions for:
    *   **Linting:** `eslint` to enforce coding standards.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Run `npm test` on every PR.
    *   **Build Previews:** Use Expo EAS to generate development builds for testers automatically.

### C. Audit Trail
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a `local_audit_logs` table. MFIs require a trail of "Who changed what and when." Every edit to a loan or borrower should create an immutable log entry.

## 🛠 Quick-Win Refactor: Performance Optimization

**Inefficient (O(N²)):**
```typescript
const paid = payments
    .filter(p => p.loanId === loan.id)
    .reduce((s, p) => s + p.amount, 0);
```

**Efficient (O(N)):**
```typescript
const paymentTotals = useMemo(() => {
  return payments.reduce((acc, p) => {
    acc[p.loanId] = (acc[p.loanId] || 0) + p.amount;
    return acc;
  }, {});
}, [payments]);

const paid = paymentTotals[loan.id] || 0;
```
