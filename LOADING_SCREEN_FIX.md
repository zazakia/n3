# ✅ Loading Screen Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Summary
The app was stuck on the loading screen showing "Initializing..." forever. The redirect logic to login page was not working.

## Root Cause
In `/app/loading.tsx`, the redirect logic was checking:
```typescript
if (initialized && (status === 'completed' || status === 'error')) {
    // redirect...
}
```

**Issue:** When user is NOT logged in:
- `initialized` becomes `true` ✅
- But sync status remains `'idle'` (never becomes 'completed' or 'error') ❌
- Therefore, the condition never triggers and the app stays on loading screen forever

## Solution
Modified the redirect logic to handle both cases:

### New Logic (lines 59-82 in loading.tsx):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    if (!initialized) return;  // Still wait for auth to initialize

    // Case 1: No user logged in → go to login immediately
    if (!user) {
        const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            router.replace('/login');
        }, 500);  // 500ms delay for smooth UX
        return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
    }

    // Case 2: User logged in → wait for sync to complete, then go to home
    if (status === 'completed' || status === 'error') {
        const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            if (role) {
                router.replace(ROLE_HOME_ROUTES[role as UserRole] as any ?? '/login');
            } else {
                router.replace('/login');
            }
        }, 800);
        return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
    }
}, [status, initialized, user, role]);
```

## Flow After Fix
```
App starts → Index redirects to /loading
    ↓
AuthContext initializes → sets initialized=true
    ↓
Loading Screen checks: if (!initialized) return;
    ↓
    Branch 1 (No User)         Branch 2 (User Exists)
    └─ if (!user)              └─ wait for sync
       → go to /login             → then go to /home
```

## .env Configuration
✅ Verified correct:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = https://dkifkklmfmawihghxrmw.supabase.co
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Valid JWT token for anonymous auth

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. **Not Logged In:** Should see loading screen briefly, then redirect to login page
2. **Logged In:** Should see loading screen with sync progress, then redirect to role-based home (admin/collector dashboard)

## Impact
- ✅ Loading screen no longer gets stuck
- ✅ Unauthenticated users go directly to login
- ✅ Authenticated users see sync progress then home screen
- ✅ No changes to authentication or sync logic
